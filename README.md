# theoretical-passy
Theoretical password reset userscript using cobbled together switching logic from SCS, initial gmail scaffolding from Latte by Merethin, and the Hare sheet builder.

1. First, when loading the script, visit https://nationstates.net/page=blank/passy and set the user agent (your main nation), the old password, and the new password. The old and new password are theoretical, I'm not sure how it will be implemented, but theoretically you need the old one to set the new one.

Does not support multi-password, but if you know which ones have which, you can do multiple sessions.

2. Then, go to your email client, and collect the password reset emails. At the moment, it just collects the asnation page on an apocalypse email, I have no idea what the password reset email will look like.

Supported Clients:

1. Gmail
2. Outlook
3. Proton
4. Fastmail
